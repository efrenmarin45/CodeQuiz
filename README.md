# Code Quiz

## How to use
1) Download files
2) Run index.html in browser
3) Try to get a score of 100!


## Purpose
This program asks the user to help, Harry, better understand some HTML, CSS, and Javascript questions by taking a timed quiz. As the user progresses through, any wrong answers will have a time penalty and any correct answers will award +5 points. A total of 100 points possible.

## Project Status
The project is complete and only has some features that I would like to see implemented in the future.


## Reflection
I took this on as a stepping stone to help me better understand DOM manipulation more. While there are still other features I'd like to implement, a lot of the hurdles that I came across the first time around are no longer outstanding issues so I feel like I can chalk that up as a win. Being able to add more features like audio cues for correct/wrong answers and local storage are next on my list for this project.
