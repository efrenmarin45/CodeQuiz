# Code Quiz

## Purpose
This program asks the user to help, Harry, better understand some HTML, CSS, and Javascript questions by taking a timed quiz. As the user progresses through, any wrong answers will have a time penalty. At the end, the user will have a chance to add their name to a highscore leaderboard. 

I took this on as a stepping stone to help me better understand DOM manipulation more. While this is still a work in progress, a lot of the issues that I came across the first time around are no longer outstanding issues so I feel like I can chalk that up as a win. Being able to produce a fully functioning app is my next goal for this project. 

## Project Status
The project is currently still being worked on to finish out the local storage feature as well as solving out some bugs. The program itself is for the most part functional with the exception of being able to take the high score at the end and being able to fully end the quiz.
